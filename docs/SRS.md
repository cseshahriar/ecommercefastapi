## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document details the requirements for a backend RESTful API for an e-commerce platform, supporting user management, product catalog, cart, order, payment, and shipping functionalities.

- **CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, Delete

---

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

This backend is a standalone RESTful API, intended to be consumed by a frontend (web/mobile). It uses FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async), MySQL, and Alembic for migrations.

### 2.2 Product Functions

- **User Account:** Registration, login, JWT-based authentication, password reset, email verification, admin roles.
- **Product Catalog:** CRUD for products and categories, image upload, search, and filtering.
- **Cart:** Add, update, remove items; view cart summary.
- **Order:** Checkout, view orders, cancel orders.
- **Payment:** Simulated payment processing, payment status tracking.
- **Shipping:** Manage addresses, track shipping status.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

- **Customer:** Can register, login, manage cart, place orders, manage addresses, view payments and shipping.
- **Admin:** All customer privileges plus product/category CRUD, shipping status updates.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

- **Backend:** Python 3.x, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy ORM, MySQL, Alembic
- **Frontend:** Any (not included) Later in ReactJS or NextJS
- **OS:** Windows (as per setup), Linux compatible

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

- Async SQLAlchemy and aiomysql
- JWT for authentication
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Environment variables via python-decouple
